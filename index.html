<h2>What I Value</h2>
<h3>Accountability</h3>
<p>
1.Accountability means taking full responsibility for my actions, decisions, and their outcomes.
<br>2.This value derives from my upbringing and school, where I was taught that actions have 
  consequences and that growth comes from owning both successes and failures.
<br>3.Accountability builds trust and credibility. In both academic, and professional, people rely on 
  others to follow through on commitments and act responsibly.
<br>4.Without accountability, trust is lost, making it hard for people to want to depend on you.
</p>
<h3>Honesty</h3>
<p>
1. Honesty is the practice of being truthful, transparent, and sincere in both action and speach.
<br>2. Honesty was instilled in me through family values and reinforced through education, where we 
   strongly believed in being truthful at all times even if it may hurt ones freelings.
<br>3. Honesty forms the foundation of trust in relationships and professional settings. 
<br>4. Dishonesty can damage reputations, destroy relationships, and even mental health.
</p>
<h3>Professionalism</h3>
<p>
1. Professionalism involves acting with respect, responsibility, and ethical awareness in 
   academic and work environments.
<br>2. This value developed through school expectations, boyscouts, and my exposure to 
   professional standards in academic and workplace settings.
<br>3. Professionalism creates a positive environment where people feel respected and confident 
   in each other’s abilities.
<br>4. A lack of professionalism can lead to damaged reputations, strained relationships, and limited 
   career opportunities.
</p>
<h3>Service</h3>
<p>
1. Service means using my skills, knowledge, and time to help others and contribute positively to 
   my community and society.
<br>2. This value originates from family experiences from when I was a child and we would donate our 
   time at church to help feed those who couldn't
<br>3. Service gives purpose to my actions and encourages ethical use of technology. It reminds me that 
   decisions should consider how they affect others, not just personal outcomes.
<br>4. Without a sense of service, actions can become self-centered and harmful.
