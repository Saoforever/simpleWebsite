<h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters in Healthcare</h2>
<p>
The healthcare industry depends on information technology to store and manage highly sensitive
patient data. Because this information includes medical histories, personal identifiers, and
insurance details, healthcare organizations are frequent targets of cyberattacks.
</p>


<h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
<p>
One essential best practice is strong access control. Healthcare organizations should use
multi-factor authentication and limit access to systems based on job roles. This reduces the
risk of unauthorized access and insider threats.
</p>
<p>
Data encryption and regular backups are also critical. Encrypting patient records protects
information even if systems are breached, while secure backups ensure continuity of care during
ransomware attacks or system failures.
</p>
<p>
Finally, employee training plays a major role in cybersecurity. Many attacks begin with phishing
emails or human error. Teaching staff how to recognize threats and follow security protocols
strengthens the organization’s overall security posture.
